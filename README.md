# Library-Management-System
A library wants to manage information about books, members, and borrowing history. We’ll design and implement the database step by step.
We’ll create three main tables:
Books: Stores information about books in the library.
Members: Stores details of library members.
BorrowHistory: Tracks who borrowed which book and when.
